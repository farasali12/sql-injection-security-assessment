- Error-Based SQL Injection
- UNION-Based SQL Injection
- Blind SQL Injection (Boolean-Based)
- Time-Based Blind SQL Injection

## Tools Used
- Browser-based testing
- SQL injection payloads
- Controlled lab environment

## Disclaimer
All testing was performed in a legal, isolated environment for educational purposes only.
